# Anomaly-Detection-
This is a simple application of anomaly-Detection using K-means clustering.The complete dataset can be downloaded from "This is a simple application of anomaly-Detection using K-means clustering.The complete dataset can be downloaded from "http://bit.ly/1ALCuZN" This dataset contains around 37 features and to effciently use these features we have to perform various preprocessing steps like mean-normalization,and remove categorical variable. The code is written in scala and the framework is used is Apache Spark.

After running this program it will print all the analomies which are present in the dataset This application can be used in online fraud detection.

To run this code- 1)Set up Apache Spark on your system. 2) place the dataset in hdfs. 3) Create the exec. jar file using Maven and eclipse. 4)use the command "./spark-submit -path to the jar file""
